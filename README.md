Final project for COP3530 Data Structures &amp; Algorithms.<br>
This application provides customized book recommendations for a user based on their input.

To run this application, 

1. Clone the repository
2. Open 2 terminal tabs in this folder - one for the frontend and one for the backend
3. In the frontend tab run:
   ```
   cd page-turner
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   You should then see a QR code in your terminal<br>
   - If you have an iPhone, download the Expo Go app on your iPhone, then click "i" in the terminal and scan the QR code
   - If you have an android, you can just scan the QR code and view the application on your phone
4. In the backend tab run:
   ```
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```
